# Information on terminology used in models

**size (pixels)**: Input resolution of the model. All are the same in this case (640x640).
**mAPval 50-95**: Mean Average Precision (mAP) over a range of Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds (from 50% to 95%). This is a measure of the model's accuracy. A higher mAP indicates better performance.
**Speed CPU ONNX (ms) and Speed A100 TensorRT (ms)**: Inference time on two different platforms (ONNX on CPU and TensorRT on NVIDIA A100 GPU). Lower is faster/better.
**params (M)**: Number of parameters in millions. Indicates the size and potentially the complexity of the model.
**FLOPs (B)**: Floating-point operations per second in billions. This provides an idea of the computational intensity of the model.

For a static camera, motion dynamics will likely be less variable than with a moving camera. In that context, consider the following:

**Accuracy vs. Speed**: If you need a more accurate model and can afford a bit more processing time, then go for models with a higher mAP. If speed is a priority, then choose a model that has lower inference time.

**Hardware Constraints**: If you have powerful hardware (e.g., NVIDIA A100 GPU), you can leverage models that are computationally intensive (higher FLOPs) but give better performance. If you're running on a CPU or more constrained hardware, you might want to consider models with fewer FLOPs and parameters.

**YOLOv8n vs. YOLOv8x**: Typically, the 'n' might denote "nano" or a smaller, faster, but less accurate model, whereas 'x' might suggest "extra" or a larger, slower, but more accurate model. The models in between might offer a balance between size/speed and accuracy.

Given these considerations:

**If you prioritize accuracy and have powerful hardware**: YOLOv8x.

**If you want a balance between speed and accuracy**: YOLOv8m or YOLOv8l.

**If you're limited by hardware or need faster processing**: YOLOv8n or YOLOv8s.
