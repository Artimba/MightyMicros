# How to Install Environment

Pre-setup: Make sure to have Python3.x installed on your computer.  

1. Run venv installation script in integrated terminal 

    a. For Windows: `.\setup_venv.bat` \
    b. For Mac/Linux: `./setup_venv.sh`

    (For Mac/Linux) The shell file might need execute permissions. This can be given via the command: \
    `chmod +x setup_venv.sh`

2. Once installed, you can activate the environment by using the command in the intregrated terminal: 

    a. For Windows: `.\mighty\Scripts\activate` \
    b. For Mac/Linux: `./mighty/bin/activate`

    You will know if you did it right if the word `(mighty)` gets appended at the beginning of the terminal line.
